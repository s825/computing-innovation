        <h1>About My Innovation</h1>
        <p>You may be wondering ,"What does Aritifical intelligence even do?". Artificial intelligence focuses on the three human cognitive skills which are learning, listening, and self-correction. AI learns the task at hand, then processes the task, and finally completes the task.
         For example, the company Amazon has an AI assistant which completes tasks for you such as playing music, adding to a list, looking up the current forecast, and sets reminders all at the user’s voice command.</p>

        <p> Another company that uses AI is Apple with their virtual assistant Siri. Siri is able to update you on sports, set reminders, show you the weather, add to a list, play your favorite music, your favorite tv show and movies, and can even set events on a calendar. All those tasks can be done with a command of the user.</p>

        <p>One of the pros about AI that can benefit the saftey of society is that Siri is now even being implemented inside newer cars called “Apple Carplay”. This feature is supposed to bring a hands-free interface so users can use Siri to choose the song they would like to play. It also does not allow the driver to text until the car is put into park for a safer driving experience.</p>
